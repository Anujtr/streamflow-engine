- Docker (optional)
- Protocol Buffers compiler (for development)

### Build and Run

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Anujtr/streamflow-engine
cd streamflow-engine

# Build all components
./scripts/build.sh

# Run the server
./bin/streamflow

# In another terminal, run the example
./bin/example

# Run performance benchmarks
./bin/benchmark -duration=30s -producers=4 -consumers=2

# Run Phase 2 enhanced demo
./bin/phase2-example

# Run Phase 2 advanced benchmarks  
./bin/phase2-benchmark -duration=30s -producers=8 -consumers=4
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build and run with Docker
docker-compose up --build

# Run with monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
docker-compose --profile monitoring up --build
```

## 📊 Performance Benchmarks

Recent Phase 2 benchmark results on MacBook Pro (M1):

```
Duration: 10.03s
Messages Produced: 316,009
Messages Consumed: 19,000  
Producer Throughput: 31,502 msg/sec
Consumer Throughput: 1,894 msg/sec
P99 Latency: 369μs
Errors: 382 (0.121%)
```

**Phase 2 Key Metrics:**

### Core Components

**Phase 1 Foundation:**
- **Message Storage**: In-memory partitioned storage with thread-safe operations
- **gRPC Server**: High-performance binary protocol API  
- **Client Library**: Producer/Consumer abstractions with connection pooling

**Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- **Consistent Hash Ring**: SHA-1 based hashing with 150 virtual nodes per partition
- **Partition Manager**: Dynamic scaling, rebalancing, and metrics collection
- **Batch Producer**: Configurable batching, compression, and retry logic
- **Consumer Groups**: Membership management, partition assignment, and failover
- **Advanced APIs**: Partition management and consumer group coordination services

## 📖 API Documentation

### Producer API

```go
producer, err := client.NewProducer(client.ProducerConfig{
    Address: "localhost:8080",
    Timeout: 30 * time.Second,
})

result, err := producer.SendSingle(ctx, "my-topic", "key", []byte("value"))
```

### Consumer API

```go
consumer, err := client.NewConsumer(client.ConsumerConfig{
    Address:     "localhost:8080",
    MaxMessages: 100,
})

messages, err := consumer.Consume(ctx, "my-topic", partition, offset, maxMessages)
```

### Health Check

```bash
# Using gRPC client
go run cmd/example/main.go

# Health endpoint will show:
# - Server status
# - Version information  
# - Runtime metrics
```

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Run with coverage
go test ./... -cover

# Run integration tests
./scripts/integration-test.sh
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Storage Layer: 100% coverage
- Client Library: 95+ coverage
- API Layer: Integration tested
- End-to-End: Full workflow tested
